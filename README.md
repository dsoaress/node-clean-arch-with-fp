# Functional Clean Architecture POC

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) for implementing a backend using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express, adhering to the principles of Clean Architecture without object-oriented. The main objective was to explore the feasibility of applying Clean Architecture with a functional programming approach, avoiding object-oriented design.

## Disclaimer

I am not an expert in functional programming. This project was created as an experiment to explore the possibility of implementing a backend system without object-oriented programming.
